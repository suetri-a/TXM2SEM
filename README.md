# TXM2SEM Image Translation

Code presented is mainly from the [original pix2pix code](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) published by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and [Taesung Park](https://github.com/taesung), and supported by [Tongzhou Wang](https://ssnl.github.io/). Their main papers are:

Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks.<br>

We have modified and simplified their original framework to work specifically for the TXM2SEM image translation task.
